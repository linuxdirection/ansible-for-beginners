To install Ansible inside a Python 3 virtual environment using \`pip\`, follow the steps outlined below. This guide assumes you have Python 3 and \`pip\` installed on your system.

\### Step 1: Install Virtualenv

First, you need to install \`virtualenv\` if it's not already installed. Open your terminal or command prompt and run:

\`\`\`sh

pip3 install virtualenv

\`\`\`

\### Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment

Navigate to the directory where you want to create your virtual environment and run:

\`\`\`sh

virtualenv -p python3 ansible\_env

\`\`\`

This command creates a new virtual environment named \`ansible\_env\` using Python 3. You can replace \`ansible\_env\` with any name you prefer for your virtual environment.

\### Step 3: Activate the Virtual Environment

Before installing any packages, you need to activate the virtual environment. To do so, use one of the following commands based on your operating system:

\- \*\*On Windows:\*\*

\`\`\`sh

.\\ansible\_env\\Scripts\\activate

\`\`\`

\- \*\*On macOS and Linux:\*\*

\`\`\`sh

source ansible\_env/bin/activate

\`\`\`

Once activated, your command prompt will change to indicate that you are now working within the \`ansible\_env\` virtual environment.

\### Step 4: Install Ansible

With the virtual environment activated, you can now install Ansible using \`pip\`:

\`\`\`sh

pip install ansible

\`\`\`

This command installs the latest version of Ansible and its dependencies into your virtual environment.

\### Step 5: Verify Installation

To verify that Ansible has been successfully installed, you can run:

\`\`\`sh

ansible --version

\`\`\`

This command should display the version of Ansible that's been installed, along with some configuration information.

\### Step 6: Deactivate the Virtual Environment

When you're done working with Ansible, you can deactivate the virtual environment by running:

\`\`\`sh

deactivate

\`\`\`

This command returns you to your system's global Python environment.

\### Conclusion

You now have a dedicated Python 3 virtual environment with Ansible installed. This setup helps manage dependencies and ensures that Ansible runs in a controlled environment, minimizing conflicts with other Python packages.
